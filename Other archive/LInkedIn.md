我是一名来自中国的大学生，在今年年初我注册了LInked的账号，经过几个月的经营，我拥有三四十名的好友，但是六七月份的某一天，我忙于进行期末考试的准备，突然发现我的账号: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yujie-he/ 无法被登录，又过了几天，发现不知为什么我的账户完全被篡改，变成了一个我不认识的美国人的信息，到了八月初，我再次寻求通过找回密码的方式进行登录，却发现账户似乎已经被完全注销了，但是我的手机号码似乎仍然被关联因而无法在此注册新的账户，我请求能够回复我的数据或者取消我的手机18800231786的关联。

十分感谢！



I am a college student from China. I registered my account at the beginning of this year. After several months of operation, I have 30 or 40 friends. 

But one day in June and July, I am busy preparing for the final exam. suddenly found my account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yujie-he/ could not be logged in. After a few more days, I found out that my account was completely tampered with and turned into a profile for an American I don't know.

By the beginning of August, I once again sought to log in by retrieving the password, only to find that the account seems to have been completely logged out, but my mobile phone number still seems to be associated and I can't register a new account here. I am requesting to be able to restore my account or cancel the association of my phone 18800231786.

Thank you very much!
